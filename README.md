# cursed-python

This is not a place of honor.

No highly esteemed deed is commemorated here.

The code here is repulsive and should not be used.

This is a collection of things that are *possible* in Python, but which should
be avoided in almost every case. It's made with love by someone who enjoys
exploring the strange consequences of Python's various features. <3
